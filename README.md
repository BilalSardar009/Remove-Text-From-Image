# Text Inpainting using OCR

This code provides a method for inpainting text in an image using OCR (Optical Character Recognition) techniques. It utilizes the `keras_ocr` library for text recognition and `OpenCV` for image manipulation and inpainting.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- `cv2` (OpenCV)
- `matplotlib`
- `keras_ocr`
- `numpy`

## Usage
1. clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BilalSardar009/Remove-Text-From-Image
   ```
2. Run the python script:
   ```bash
   python RemoveText.py 
   ```
3. It will create a new image named as text_removed_image.jpg

## Example
1. Input Image:
![Input Image:](https://github.com/BilalSardar009/Remove-Text-From-Image/blob/main/Removing%20Text%20From%20image/1.jpg)
2. Output Image:
![Output Image](https://github.com/BilalSardar009/Remove-Text-From-Image/blob/main/Removing%20Text%20From%20image/text_removed_image.jpg)
